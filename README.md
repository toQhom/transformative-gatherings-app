  **Overview of Gather**
 -----------------------------------------
 ALl of the code other than this README is inside the  gather colder. Gather is an app
 that is used to give people resources on how to have transformative gatherings. If
 you open the app or look through the /lib/main.dart file then you will see and about
 page that will give you more information about what these types of gatherigns are.

 We provided links to TEDTalks, idea boards, and other websites that can help anyone
 plan more meaningful events to get people talking to eachother in a poisitive and 
 non-confrintational way.

  **Plan for Gather - Moving Forward**
 -----------------------------------------
 Before we got started we created wireframes for each of the pages that we wanted to 
 have on this application. For those who are examining this project, or those who want
 to go forward and improve upon this app the wireframes in the gitHub repository give
 you a clear vision of what out goal was going into this even though it wasn't executed
 fully.
  -----------------------------------------
 **Why did we create this app?**
 -----------------------------------------
 Flutter is something 2 of us had tried many years ago and our expierence with it was
 subpar to say the least. Now that we have had some years of coding under our belt and
 the documentation for Flutter has gotten better we decided to shoot our shot at the 
 Language one more time inhopes to develope an app easily for andriod and ios devices.
 I'd say that this project is a success :)

 We created this project in the span of 24 hours for TECHNICA 2021.

 This hack was made to have a large social impact and bring people closer together.
 We feel this hack will have a Neighborhood impact by potentionally being used to
 bring people together in meaninful ways and open up the lines of communication for 
 those who don't normally feel like they are heard. 

 We also tried to design our app in a way that was friendly and inclsuive to as many
 people as possible. Using drastic color changes for the hard of hearing, text on the
 different pages and images that a screen reader can pick up (however we need to implment
 this further but we did the best we could in the time).

 We also had 2 beginner hackers on our team who had a great time not only learning a
 new language but learning how beenficial Hackathons can be and the joys of collborating
 with new people.

 **Running the Code**
 -----------------------------------------
 You will need to download the FLutter, Dart, Android Ios
 Emulator exstenions in order to run this code as well. You will also need to add the
 flutter bin onto your path when you want to run this code. You can check to see if
 you have everything up and running properly by typing "flutter doctor" in the command
 line and once you have all green check marks by each statement for the IDE you are 
 using to run this code you are ready to run and start changing this application. 

 Navigate to the Gather Folder. Run "flutter run" in the terminal. This will open 
 we web browser that will show you the app. The spacing for the pages will look off
 because it is meant to be on a phone. IF you have andriod studio you can create 
 an emulator of a phone and run the application off that or plug your own phone in 
 and run Gather on your own phone as well.
