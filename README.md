 **Overview of Gather**
-----------------------------------------
Gather is an app that is used to give people resources on how to have transformative gatherings, which are gatherings that seek to have lasting impacts on their participants in a way that does not lead to great divide. Within the app, users can find information on what transformative gatherings are, answers to common questions and misconceptions, tips on how to apply the principles in your daily life, and links to more resources about transformative gatherings. We provided links to TEDTalks, idea boards, and other websites that can help anyone plan more meaningful events to get people talking to each other in a poisitive and non-confrontational way. 

All of the code other than this README is inside the  gather folder. If you open the app or look through the /lib/main.dart file then you will see an about page that will give you more information about what these types of gatherings are.

 **Plan for Gather - Moving Forward**
-----------------------------------------
Before we got started we created wireframes for each of the pages that we wanted to have on this application. For those who are examining this project, or those who want to go  improve upon this app, the wireframes that in the GitHub repository give you a clear vision of what the end goal is. We would like to improve both the UI and UX of the design, to give the users a more pleasant experience while using the app. There are also a lot of improvements that could be made to the accessibility aspects of the app, such as ensuring that the fonts are all compatible with screen readers and providing alternative captions for all of the images on our app. 

We would also like the expand the app with a lot more research about transformative gatherings, to both improve the information we are sending out, and to provide more external resources to the users through the Links tab. One area we definitely would like to provide more information on is the differences in transformative gatherings in the workplace versus among friends and family, and more resources for how this can be applied in virtual meetings. We also have a vision of adding in-app host support for those who wish to host a transformative gathering. This would be in the form of in-app activities that people can do to spark conversation in an impactful way, and ways our can cater to the specific needs of the gathering the user is hosting.

 **Why did we create this app?**
-----------------------------------------
Gather was designed in order to educate people about the principles of transformative gatherings, and assist them in applying the principles in their everyday gatherings. Throughout the past few years, we have seen a surge in the amount of conversations people are having about critical issues facing our society, with the unfortunate consequence of social divide. We seek to encourage people to have conversations in a way that both has a lasting impact on all members, and succeeds in bringing them closer instead of causing more divide. We hope that everyone can find a way to have more transformative gatherings in their daily lives.

We chose to use Flutter because Flutter is something 2 of us had tried many years ago and our expierence with it was subpar to say the least. Now that we have had some years of coding under our belt and the documentation for Flutter has gotten better we decided to shoot our shot at the language one more time in hopes of developing an app easily for Android and iOS devices. It was a bit of a personal challenge. I'd say that this project is a success :)

We created this project in the span of 24 hours for TECHNICA 2021.

This hack was made to have a large social impact and bring people closer together. We feel this hack will have a Neighborhood impact by potentionally being used to bring people together in meaningful ways and open up the lines of communication for those who don't normally feel like they are heard. 

We also tried to design our app in a way that was friendly and inclsuive to as many people as possible. Using drastic color changes for the hard of hearing, text on the different pages and images that a screen reader can pick up (however we need to implment this further but we did the best we could in the time we had).

We also had 2 beginner hackers on our team who had a great time not only learning a new language but learning how beenficial Hackathons can be and the joys of collborating with new people.

**Running the Code**
-----------------------------------------
You will need to download the Flutter, Dart, Android iOS Emulator extensions in order to run this code . You will also need to add the flutter bin onto your path when you want to run this code. You can check to see if you have everything up and running properly by typing "flutter doctor" in the command line and once you have all green check marks by each statement for the IDE you are using to run this code you are ready to run and start changing this application. 

Navigate to the Gather Folder. Run "flutter run" in the terminal. This will open we web browser that will show you the app. The spacing for the pages will look off because it is meant to be on a phone. IF you have andriod studio you can create  an emulator of a phone and run the application off that or plug your own phone in and run Gather on your own phone as well.
